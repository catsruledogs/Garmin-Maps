# Garmin-Maps
This is a project to get the latest Garmin maps on older Garmin devices for free.
I got a copy of these maps from Garmin MapInstall and can use them on any older device thanks to Garmin Unlocker(Unofficial),
These maps are of the entire United States courtesey of catsruledogs.
Maps uploaded with MediaFire.
These maps are maintained and uploaded roughly every 6 months.
